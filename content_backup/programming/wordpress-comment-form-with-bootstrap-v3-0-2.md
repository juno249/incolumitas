Hey everybody!

In this short article I will explain how I designed my wordpress theme's
comment section with bootstrap 3.0.2. For the most recent changes, you
find my [theme on github](https://github.com/NikolaiT/clearcontent/). If
you want to see a live demo, just inspect the comment form on this site.
It uses exactly this bootstrap styled form I am discussing here.

In order to follow the content's of this blog post, you should have
basic experience with PHP and HTML/CSS.

The problem
-----------

The tricky question here is, whether we can use a action or filter hook
to manipulate the comment form to our liking, or if we have to use and
modify the original comment\_form() function directly. Our goal is to
decorate the form with some bootstrap widget classes and use the
bootstrap grid layout. We want to obtain a horizontal form, such as
demonstrated [here](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-horizontal).
After a quick search, I found the function [comment\_form( \$args,
\$post\_id
);](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/comment_form) in the
wordpress codex. While it looks promising on the first glimpse, some
hindrances become clear after further thinking through. The function's
description says:

> Most strings and form fields may be controlled through the \$args
> array passed into the function, while you may also choose to use the
> comment\_form\_default\_fields filter to modify the array of default
> fields if you'd just like to add a new one or remove a single field.
> All fields are also individually passed through a filter of the form
> comment\_form\_field\_\$name where \$name is the key used in the array
> of fields.

But there are two html elements in the function that aren't passed
through any filters/actions: The \<form\> element itself (With the
bootstrap comment form applied, the \<form\> element should be *\<form
class="form-horizontal" role="form"\>*) and the submit button that needs
to be wrapped in the following div element:

    <div class="form-group">
    </div>

Therefore we can't achieve the bootstrap horizontal comment form with
passing modified \$args to comment\_form() template.

A Solution
----------

My quick & dirty solution was to just copy the comment\_form() code from
[comment-template.php](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.7.1/src/wp-includes/comment-template.php#L1509),
incorporate it in our theme (within functions.php for example) and then
modify it directly to our liking. I guess that doing so is
controversial, because there might be other ways to style the elements
that aren't affected by any filters. For instance, if we can't modify
the \<form\> attribute with the boostrap class "form-horizontal", we
could alternatively just wrap the whole comment\_form() within a div
element of the same class (Not tested if it really works though).

Anyways, my modified comment\_form template can be found
[here](https://github.com/NikolaiT/clearcontent/blob/master/inc/template-tags.php)
under the name clearcontent\_comment\_form().

The solution is not really nice, because it violates the good wordpress
design pattern, namely avoiding duplicate code with hooks. The
disadvantage is the the potential inconsistency with the real
comment\_form() code: Whenever wordpress updates, I need to change my
custom comment\_form() too in order to make sure the interfaces stays
stable that comment\_form() provides. This is very inconvenient to say
the least.
