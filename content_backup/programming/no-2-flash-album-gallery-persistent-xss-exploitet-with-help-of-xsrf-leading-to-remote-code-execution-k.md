**PLUGIN: http://wordpress.org/plugins/flash-album-gallery/  
AFFECTED VERSION: 3.01  
DOWNLOADS: 840,714  
RISK: MEDIUM/HIGH**

The following blog post addresses a critical (chain) of security issues
in the version 3.01 of flash-album-gallery  
which eventually leads to remote code execution. The exploit is not
completely automatically and needs a minimal amount  
of social engineering. Nevertheless I rate the danger at a medium/high
level {Probably even worse than a fully automatable SQL injection).

First of all, I need to say that the plugin code lacks a fair amount of
secure programming techniques and has inherent design flaws as far  
as I can say this [I am not a software engineer, I do security as a
hobby]. Assumingly, this is a direct result of heterogenous and  
evolutionary growth of the software.  
I researched flash-album-gallery mainly in June 2013 and after some
weeks I found a CSRF vulnerability in combination with  
a stored XSS. But on the same time I was preparing to contact the
author and reveal my findings, I noticed a new version and  
the bug seemed to be found by an independent researcher. See below the
lines '\* Fix: vulnerability with albums' and  
'\* Fix: XSS bugs reported by Ken S for the White Fir Design Bug
Bounty'.

    = v3.00 - 26.06.2013 =
    * Fix: Free skins settings reset to default after plugin update
    * Fix: XSS bugs reported by Ken S for the White Fir Design Bug Bounty
    * Fix: small bugfixes
    * New: iOS application 'MyPGC' for Flagallery plugin now available on the App Store

    = v2.78 - 26.06.2013 =
    * Fix: bundled free skins not copied to flagallery-skins directory

    = v2.77 - 25.06.2013 =
    * Fix: vulnerability with albums
    * Fix: PHP Notices
    * Fix: Compatibility with some modern themes
    * Update: New version of swfupload
    * Update: Compatibility with Wordpress SEO plugin
    * Update: Update code for default skins
     

I considered the issue as solved [To my shame] and called the
researching an end and forgot about flash-album-gallery.  
But currently, I was revisiting the code and saw that there is still
exactly the same issue with another variable and file.

The concerned file is music-box.php situated at
\\wp-content\\plugins\\flash-album-gallery\\admin\\music-box.php at LINE
17. This is the vulnerable function:
    
    :::PHP
    function flag_music_controler() {
        if (isset($_POST['importfolder']) && $_POST['importfolder']){
            check_admin_referer('flag_addmp3');
            $mp3folder = $_POST['mp3folder'];
            if ( !empty($mp3folder) )
                flagAdmin::import_mp3($mp3folder);
        }
        $mode = isset($_REQUEST['mode'])? $_REQUEST['mode'] : 'main';
        $action = isset($_REQUEST['bulkaction'])? $_REQUEST['bulkaction'] : false;
        if($action == 'no_action') {
            $action = false;
        }
        switch($mode) {
            case 'sort':
                include_once (dirname (__FILE__) . '/playlist-sort.php');
                flag_playlist_order();
            break;
            case 'edit':
                $file = urlencode($_GET['playlist']);
                if(isset($_POST['updatePlaylist'])) {
                    $title = esc_html($_POST['playlist_title']);
                    $descr = esc_html($_POST['playlist_descr']);
                    $data = array();
                    foreach($_POST['item_a'] as $item_id => $item) {
                        if($action=='delete_items' && in_array($item_id, $_POST['doaction']))
                            continue;
                        $data[] = $item_id;
                    }
                    flagGallery::flagSaveWpMedia();
                    flagSavePlaylist($title,$descr,$data,$file);
                }
                if(isset($_POST['updatePlaylistSkin'])) {
                    flagSavePlaylistSkin($file);
                }
                include_once (dirname (__FILE__) . '/manage-playlist.php');
                flag_playlist_edit();
            break;
            case 'save':
                if(isset($_POST['items_array'])){
                    $title = esc_html($_POST['playlist_title']);
                    $descr = esc_html($_POST['playlist_descr']);
                    $data = $_POST['items_array'];
                    $file = isset($_REQUEST['playlist'])? urlencode($_REQUEST['playlist']) : false;
                    flagGallery::flagSaveWpMedia();
                    flagSavePlaylist($title,$descr,$data, $file);
                }
                if(isset($_GET['playlist'])) {
                    include_once (dirname (__FILE__) . '/manage-playlist.php');
                    flag_playlist_edit();
                } else {
                    flag_created_playlists();
                    flag_music_wp_media_lib();
                }
            break;
            case 'add':
                if(isset($_POST['items']) && isset($_GET['playlist'])){
                    $added = $_POST['items'];
                } elseif(isset($_GET['playlist'])) {
                    $added = $_COOKIE['musicboxplaylist_'.urlencode($_GET['playlist'])];
                } else {
                    $added = false;
                }
                flag_music_wp_media_lib($added);
            break;
            case 'delete':
                flag_playlist_delete(urlencode($_GET['playlist']));
            case 'main':
                if(isset($_POST['updateMedia'])) {
                    flagGallery::flagSaveWpMedia();
                    flagGallery::show_message( __('Media updated','flag') );
                }
            default:
                flag_created_playlists();
                flag_music_wp_media_lib();
            break;
        }

        }

Well, alone in this function and its subsequent calls, there are more
security bugs than I can descibe here.  
But to just name the one critical I mentioned before, this POST request
inserts tainted data into a file, which  
is lateron echoed back to the admin menu which triggers an XSS.

    =============================================================================================

Explanation:

Due to inpropper coding style, this request is not protected by a nonce,
which would prevent a CSRF attack. For explanation of nonces and why  
they are impportant, look here:
http://www.prelovac.com/vladimir/improving-security-in-wordpress-plugins-using-nonces.  
However, the author  
probably intended to protect it with a nonce, because he actually
inserted one in the form field here:

    <!-- #new_playlist -->
    <div id="new_playlist" style="display: none;" >
         <form id="form_new_playlist" method="POST" action="<?php echo $filepath; ?>" accept-charset="utf-8">
    ===> <?php wp_nonce_field('flag_thickbox_form'); ?>
         <input type="hidden" id="new_playlist_mp3id" name="items_array" value="" />
         <input type="hidden" id="new_playlist_bulkaction" name="TB_bulkaction" value="" />
         <input type="hidden" name="mode" value="save" />
         <input type="hidden" name="page" value="music-box" />
         <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3" >

Unfortunately, this nonce is actually never checked with a appropriate
function like  
- wp\_verify\_nonce(\$nonce, \$action = -1)  
- check\_ajax\_referer( \$action = -1, \$query\_arg = false, \$die =
true )  
- check\_admin\_referer(\$action = -1, \$query\_arg = '\_wpnonce')

Henceforth, alone this constitutes a XSRF, which for itself is a
security threat. Because of the missing nonce check in all cases of the
switch statement  
in the above code excerpt, this requests for example deletes any album
specified by the GET parameter playlist:  

http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=flag-music-box&mode=delete&playlist={Which?}

But back to main issue. Remember that we can trick any wordpress admin
with a poisoned page and a installation with this plugin to execute  
the above cases in the switch statement. Now consider the case save.
There is a call to a function named flagSavePlaylist().  
This function saves a music playlist to a xml file. Every parameter
that is written to the xml file is propperly escaped with  
functions like htmlspechialchars(). But one parameter is (strangely)
ignored. The variable \$skin is populated with user  
submitable input and later written to the xml file. (See below the two
arrows). Please note, that an exploitation attempt will lead to an error
message  
printed (See "!Error! ===\>" below) because file\_get\_contents() is
called with a string constructed with the tainted \$skin variable.
Script code  
rarily looks like valid paths. But this doesn't hinder the working of
the flow of the exploitation process.

                        if(wp_mkdir_p(ABSPATH.$flag_options['galleryPath'].'playlists/')) {
                                if( flagGallery::saveFile($playlistPath,$content,'w') ){
                                        flagGallery::show_message(__('Playlist Saved Successfully','flag'));
                                }
                        } else {
                                flagGallery::show_message(__('Create directory please:','flag').'"/'.$flag_options['galleryPath'].'playlists/"');
                        }
                }
        }

Now we know that tainted [html/javascript] data is in a xml file. This
is not dangerous by itself [But really bad at least].  
But what if this data is written back to the browser without
sanitation? Then we could write any script code within a admin  
session.

But this is exactly what happens here in the file \\wp-content\\plugins\\flash-album-gallery\\admin\\music-box.php at LINE 386:

    :::PHP
     <?php if($added===false) { ?>
                                        <input name="updateMedia" class="button-primary" style="float: right;" type="submit" value="<?php _e('Update Media','flag'); ?>" />
                                        <?php if ( function_exists('json_encode') ) { ?>
                                        <select name="bulkaction" id="bulkaction">

                                        <?php } ?>
                        <a href="<?php echo admin_url( 'media-new.php'); ?>" class="button"><?php _e('Upload Music','flag'); ?></a>

        <?php } else { ?>
                                        <input type="hidden" name="mode" value="save" />
                                        <input style="width: 80%;" type="text" id="items_array" name="items_array" readonly="readonly" value="<?php echo $added; ?>" />
                                        <input type="hidden" name="playlist_title" value="<?php echo esc_html(stripslashes($playlist['title'])); ?>" />
    ===>                                <input type="hidden" name="skinname" value="<?php echo $playlist['skin']; ?>" />
    ===>                                <input type="hidden" name="skinaction" value="<?php echo $playlist['skin']; ?>" />
                                        <textarea style="display: none;" name="playlist_descr" cols="40" rows="1"><?php echo esc_html(stripslashes($playlist['description'])); ?></textarea>
                                        <input name="addToPlaylist" class="button-secondary" type="submit" value="<?php _e('Update Playlist','flag'); ?>" />
        <?php } ?>

Hence, the form which creates the request is also responsible for the
writing the tainted data back to the screen. If find it rather strange
that  
all the other echo function usages are wrapped with esc\_html() calls
but it was forgotten that \$playlist['skin'] holds tainted data as
well.  
Maybe the changes in the last fix [As reported by 'Ken S'] weren't that
deep. But more likely, this is just another bug which hasn't been found
before.

Now what can an attacker do with this exploit?

He could gain access to the server and remote code execution for
example. Imagine we tricked an wordpress administrator which  
still has valid admin cookies for his wordpress site [Which is quite
often the case when you look at your blog] into visiting a  
site with a hidden form. You cold for example write a comment on the
wordpress site with a link to the attacking site, which incorporates  
the attacking code below. This would be a quite strong attack, since
every wordpress administrator is happy to see comments on his site
[Source:  
I am a wordpress admin myself]. Then he is genuinely interested to
follow the link. Why should he assume that it is dangerous? Lot's of
people leave  
the link of their own sites in wordpress comment section. As soon as
the wordpress administrator [He needs to be logged in, which is normally
the case]  
follows the link, the server is entirely busted. No need to crack
password hashes or find further privilege escalation ways. Why? See
below the code that  
is executed if he follows the link:

                    postdata = "";
                    for(var key in pd) {
                        postdata += (key + "=" + pd[key] + "&");
                    }
                    postdata = postdata.substr(0, postdata.length-1); // rstrip the last &

            <div id="success_indicator"></div>
        </body>
    </html>

Then as soon as the payload is executed, the following exploit code is
loaded from another site which actually  
does the evil stuff [See code above, the last lines are probably the
most interesting]. It basically uses the upload functionality in
wordpress to change plugincode.  
This leads to remote code execution and the worst case scenario
happened: An attacker can issue system() calls with the permissions  
of the web server.

The exploit code:

    /*

     * Site: incolumitas.com
     * Easy as pie.
     * What: Use this code when you found a stored XSS in a wordpress plugin to gain RCE.
     * How: A wordpress admin needs to run this code in his browser with a valid session id.
     * Idea: Mofify the flash-album-gallery plugin via wordpress admin panel.
     *

Conclusion

What was shown above, is just one specific bug in the
flash-album-gallery plugin. I think that there might be lots more. If
you want to see me notes  
of my work, please visit the following file I made during my research
at very bottom of this [large] mail.

But honestly, I have to say you that there are still lots of bugs in the
code and that it would need a rather large amount of time and  
some dull hours of work to locate the vast majority of them [Forget
about finding all bugs in software in general]. This means, that I  
won't continue spending a lot of time on this project.

Additionally, I have sent this writeup to the wordpress-security bug
bounty program because you know, I would always be happy for some dimes
to  
keep my server runnin :D

If you have questions, feel free to contact me.

I am going to publish this mail on my blog as soon as you guys updated
the code and the users had some time to switch versions. But please keep
in mind:  
I would really do some serious work in order to find all the bugs!

I advise to uninstall it and NOT use this plugin, before big changes are
made to improve the security architecture.

PS: Maybe you are interested too have a look on the script I wrote to
locate bugs like this:

    # Just a nonce itself does nothing, the action must be actually confirmed.

    # Nonces are random, one time tokens which are usally send with a critical request/form
    # a user can execute in a application. Before the action takes place, the app has to confirm
    # that the nonce is the same as genertated while the form was crafted. If this is not the case,

    # Approach: We treat simply all strings between braces as possible action arguments. There will be
