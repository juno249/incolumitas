I am a 24 year old computer science and business student, having graduated with my bachelors in 2015.

During the last several years I was interested in web
application security. I learned lots of different techniques and gained
interesting insight in the 'scene' but I never really had the motivation
to host my own projects and present myself to the abyss of the internet.
Now I do and I am really looking forward to feed the community with code
snippets and some of my ideas (There are many ideas – too many – but
only a fraction that I really realize ). You think I might do some
programming work for you? Contact me!

Maybe you want to read some of my point of views on the security
industry / scene:

-   Anti virus companies are not usefull in many cases. These companies
    earn millions and zillions dollars whilst seeding fear and
    misinformation. There is no such thing as 100 percent security. I'm
    going to implement and publish different ways and methods of how to
    circumvent such antivirus programs. I'm pretty sure, that even my
    virtual private server is hackable with a decent amount of
    determination.
-   Hacker break into systems. I don't share the completely euphemistic
    and somehow unrealistic metaphor of a hacker as a slightly socially
    awkward person who hacks for the sake of his technical amazement.
    There are many motivations which lead persons to break stuff. I
    appreciate the amount of creativity and determination required to
    commit a great 'hack', even if comitted by a evil criminal mind, as
    well as I admire techniques invented by ingenius white-hats to
    protect the unaware common user...
-   There's no hacker programming language. You can code almost anything
    in any language. If you judge the work of anybody because you
    dislike the language, you lose...

Techniques I tinkered with in the past:

-   Basic understanding of Web Design (I guess you see that it is
    actually pretty basic: This is my own WordPress Theme)
-   Basic Knowledge in C (WinApi and Linux System Programming) and
    Python (3.4)
-   I like asynchronous IO and thus Twisted. But sometimes I do stuff
    directly with epoll/select/poll in C
-   Basic programming skills in Java, PHP, Bash
-   Pretty broad knowledge of websecurity

And here some stuff I really want to learn and achieve in the future
(Without any order, that'd indicate prevalence) (Updated on 11.11.2013):

-   Learning to speak Spanish fluently
-   Better mathematical understanding (algorithms)
-   Becoming more disciplined with my projects - Often I just begin
    stuff and never end it.
-   Diving into low level stuff and fiddling around with
    debuggers/assembler and kernel-land

Maybe you are reading this and think that I might help you in a specific
situation or you have a job opportunity for me? I'll happily answer your
mails.
