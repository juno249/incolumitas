This section is about my projects. I do my programming stuff mostly in Python.
Sometimes I also use C, Java, PHP or Javascript. I know a little bit of webdesign too. 

They currently are:

- [GoogleScraper]({filename}/pages/googlescraper-py.md)
- [SVGCaptcha](http://incolumitas.com/svgcaptcha/ "SVG Captcha")
- [Lichess Bot]({filename}/pages/lichess-bot.md) based on Stockfish engine
