      <p>A short while ago I needed to implement a little web safe base64
en/decoder and couldn't find any good small example in the width of the
internet, so I decided to do my own dirty one. I hope I help somebody
with this Â little demonstration code...</p>
<p>I used Pelles C Compiler to build this program, but I am optimistic that
it works on every common C Compiler, since it's quite close to the C11
standard.</p>

  <div>
      <p>Well, it has been a hell of a time since I updated my blog. Honestly, I
was kind of unmotivated doing anything on my VPS, but recently I solved
some old issues (setting up DNS server, general administration things on
my ubuntu 12.04) and I thought: Yeah, it's definitely time to feed my
countless readers (yeah, you just met the first time my irony) with new
interesting nibbles. And since I am a more or less motivated Spanish
student, I thought I could share my pros and cons with duolingo.com.</p>
<p>I started learning Spanish approximately 5 months ago, when I began my
spontaneous planned trip to Costa Rica. I was brutally thrown into (at
least compared to Europe) very poor country and took for 5 weeks Spanish
classes. Retrospectively, I'd say that I learned pretty quick how to
communicate and express myself, but I completly fucked up my
understanding of the language on the long term, because I learned it on
the incorrect way. Before I even understood what my discussion partner
intented to say and would have exposed me therefore in a silly but
perfectly normal situation when I requested the unknown word/sentence,
where I would need to reveal that I didn't understood, Â I just continued
chatting and babbled in incorrect Spanish, just to save the conversation
and my misplaced ego. Back in Europe, I realized that I need to build up
a solid fundament, before I dare myself to improve, so duolingo.com came
convenient.</p>
<p>First of all: Duolingo.com is absolutely addictive. You can gain skill
points to monitor your learning curve and you can even track other
learners to compare, which additionaly boosts your ambition. There are
lots of courses and you need roughly 3-5 months to complete the grammer
part, if you learn 100 points each day. I need normally around 45
minutes to gain my 100 points. Then every course consits of a
translation part, which states the initial purpose of the whole platform
and will bring light into your smouldering question: Why the hell offers
duolingo.com free high quality language curses, whereby other platforms
sometimes claim for an equivalent supply a great amount of money?</p>
<p>Well, the idea behind duolingo is, that the many hundred thousands
learners will translate documents. These documents could be blog entries
of a very successful internet platform in the english language area. But
now, the 500 million Spanish speaking people on this earth can't access
this obviously interesting information and therefore, a lot of potential
advertising consumers are just lost. The idea is, that the thousands of
learners translate these valuable information for to make them
accessible by other target groups. Duolingo.com plans to sell
translation services and I asume that out there in the wildlife, such a
service is sought. Now that we discussed the general concept behind
duolingo.com, how good can you effectively learn the foreign language?</p>
<p>In general, I strongly think that there is no such thing as a didactic
wondertool, which turns you into a native speaker in serveral weeks or
even months. You will adapt and understand a great deal of a language if
you all day long learn it, live it and you are completly surrounded by
it. This is the case if you make an abroad year on a foreign universtiy
for example. Then, if you are motivated and if you're extroverted,you'll
probably be fluent after 3 or 4 months. But if you learn 1 to 2 hours a
day on duolingo.com, you have a much harder path to follow. After 4
months of daily learning on duolingo, you have a nice vocabulary and a
idea of how the language works, but you don't really feel it and won't
have this verbal/emotional relationship towards the sound and feeling of
the culture/language itself. You'll be able to translate advanced
content into Spanish and you will most likely understand the idea behind
a Spanish book, but you can't really use the language in daily speech.
Duolingo replaces in my opinion the common schoolastic approach and
increases the fun level, but it can't teach you a language. There we
will need a different strategy: Learning in webcam lessons with foreign
people out there! I guess there are thousands of young folks out there
who want to learn your language and you want to learn their, so you can
exchange and learn from each other. Then, there wouldn't be any
hindrance to learn a language completly in the internet. An amazing
idea!</p>

      Posted on Mo 23 Juli 2012 in <a href="/category/uncategorized.html">Uncategorized</a>
      &#8226; Tagged with
      <a href="/tag/uncategorized.html">Uncategorized</a>    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p><em>Have you ever wanted to know some strategies and hints how to be more
successful in your daily work?</em></p>
<p>Well, here, i'll compile a list of thoughts and scenarios of effective working, which worked for me or
seems to be at least reasonable in my future working career.</p>
<p>To illustrate and give an example for every wisdom, we use the example
for a job assignment I could found myself in: The fictional job requires
the accomplishment of a security audit of the employers content
management system written in PHP. We have access to all sources,
although the project is proprietary and is under a restrictive license.</p>
<h3>1. Develop broad general knowledge.</h3>
<p>The curios reader would ask now, why the hell do we need a proper
general knowledge to scan a web application for programming errors which
might weaken its security? Well, before you begin reading every line of
code and do the formal, rather static part of your work, you'd better
square the context of your task with your general knowledge: Where do
the people, who wrote the application live at? Which language do the
speak? What does the company which runs the cms exactly offer?</p>
<h3>2. Work at least 25 minutes at a time</h3>
<p>Have you ever obsevered yourself Â working very unsteadily and you
constantly interrupt your working sessions? Well, this is very bad for
the quality of your work, since the amount you learned or did can be
calculated after common sense similar to something like the following:</p>
<p>Stuff_Done = Time * Concentration</p>
<p>If you work a lot, but you're concentration is weak because you brain
just does not have the time to accustom to your task, the efficiency of
your output will most likely suffer. Just force yourself to concentrate
you on your work. Do just the specific task, don't look up your emails,
go to the toilet or make yourself a coffee. No topic change or bigger
semantic gap should distort the session. Set up a alarm clock to
actually measure the time.</p>
<h3>3. Become an expert in few things</h3>
<p>This is very important for me and somehow contradictory to the first
rule.</p>
<p>In our modern times and since ever changing learning methods and
information processing improvements, there's still nothing who beats the
simple stubborn learning by heart way.<br />
You should know a few tools very good. I will for example try to master sooner or later the programming
language Python. It's a very abstract and huge scripting language with a
big standard library, but if you once just know the majority of the
build in functions and modules and you automatically use them, you
productivity will increase distinctively.<br />
Just imagine you want to make
a first rough scan of the source code of the CMS with a set of regexes
who match common security flaws: The best way would be to use grep or
egrep and code a simple bash script to accomplish the task, but what if
you first have to seek for a lot of meta information how to make a while
loop in bash, what the command line arguments in grep exactly mean and
which regex syntax grep requests and the like?<br />
Well, if you then use your good old Python knowledge, you exactly know how to pursue, although
it might not be that elegant and appropriate way to do. Using your old
and established toolset, you can focus on the task and won't get
distracted that fast.</p>
<h3>4. Don't fuck with yourself</h3>
<p>One of the worst motivation and workflow killers is yourself. Once you
decide to pursue a goal you should try with all power to reach it. There
are thousands of hindrances which make it hard and they sometimes seem
impossible to overcome, but the worst of all these obstacles is you
own ego:</p>
<p>Imagine you intended to create a simple guestbook with a specific
functionality and a handy design, but after a few weeks, due to your
stressful and busy time, the task becomes unimportant and you start to
spend your attention on other stuff.<br />
This is incorrect, because you betray yourself. Even if the intentional purpose of the idea might
change or the task itself is barely unreachable because of its
complexity, legality or significance, you should try hard to terminate
and finish the task. Nothing destroys more credibility and willpower to
start over with new projects, than a semi-finished, never ended task.
You self esteem will most likely suffer too, because you'll ask yourself
constantly: Am I beginning right now one of these never ending projects?</p>
<p>Best practice to prevent this behavior is to keep a diary, which tracks
the exact definition of the goals, the progress and other related notes
according the project. You should define a dead line and if it is
violated the project must definitively fail.</p>
<h3>3. Intrinsic motivation</h3>
<p>Wikipedia defines intrinisc motivation in the following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Intrinsic motivation</strong> refers to motivation that is driven by an
interest or enjoyment in the task itself, and exists within the
individual rather than relying on any external pressure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, for every big project in your live, like the chosen direction of
your'e studies or profession, you just can succeed if you like doing it.
It might be possible to force yourself, but it's not the intention of
this post to offer a guide to torture yourself. First ask if you
principally like what you do, then do it right and in a correct way.</p>

      <p>Hey World!</p>
<h3>Before you leave!</h3>
<p>This blog and homepage is under construction. Due the fact that Im
currently implementing my own little wordpress theme and the rather
embarassing circumstance that my design knowledge is pretty ...eehhm...
basic, you'd better stay patient until you see the procution level of
this blog...That can last several weeks.</p>
<p>I am a 21 year old german programmer and hopefully somewhen in the
future a freelancing security consultant. In the foreseable future, I'll
post here audit sessions, papers and tutorials on this blog. I would
consider myself as a whitehat, so don't expect illicit stuff from me. My
favourite programming languages are Python and C. Everything I do for
myself and can be painless done in those programming languages, will be
done in one of these.</p>
<p>Maybe you ask yourself what <strong>incolumitas.com</strong> means?</p>
<p>Well, it's the latin translation for <strong>safety</strong> and since every good
domain name is already taken, I just switched to a different language
(latin if you're curious) and a not so common word for safety. The DNS
name matches perfectly my needs, because it points directly to the main
intention of this site:</p>
<p><em>Offering security services.</em></p>
<p>You can hire me. Don't hesitate to ask me anything...</p>
