    <p>I realised once more, that, when I excessively play bullet chess, I tend
to stagnate or my performance even goes down the tubes. The reason
behind this, I am assuming, the absence of defined goal or when I play
without thinking (as far as thinking in bullet chess is the legit word)
or other bad behaviour, as listening to music...</p>
<p>Therefore, I will try a little experiment: I play every day not more
than 10 bullet games. This is around 20 minutes of playing. But every
time I lose, I have to to 6 full and slow chin-ups. I'll play on
chess.com and my starting rating is right now <strong>1924</strong>, which actually
is pretty high for me. Nevertheless, my goal is to reach ELO 2050. My
all time highscore is <strong>1974. </strong>Let's go and breake some records...</p>
<p>Ok let the journey begin :)</p>
<ul>
<li>26.11.2012: <strong>1924 - 1896. </strong>Did around 30 chin-ups. Tired as hell.
    Lost too many times :)</li>
<li>28.11.2012 <strong>1896 - 1903. </strong>Back in the 1900s. Did lot's of chin
    ups. My game improved slightly, I think more and deeper. My speed is
    still to slow...</li>
<li>29.11.2012 <strong>1903 - 1900. </strong>I am stagnating, I have the impression
    that I still lack creativity and don't really want to play. My
    motivation is weak, but I am ways more concentrated compared to
    playing endless long sessions. 4 from 10 games were chin-ups. That
    means 24 chin ups :)</li>
<li>30.11.2012<strong>1900 - 1888</strong>. What the fuck? I play excellent but
    freaking slow :/</li>
<li>1.12.2012 <strong>1888 - 1926</strong>. It goes up and up :)</li>
<li>2.12.2012 <strong>1926 - 1945. </strong>Seems like I am back in the solid 1900s.
    This rating is close to my all time high and I am looking forward to
    make a new record and to fullfill my goal!</li>
<li>3.12.2012 <strong>1945 - 1865</strong>. Played like 50 games. That's the
    punishment. That was this opponent who really made me angry. Next
    time, I'll stick to the plan and won't get emotional. I shouldn't
    play more than 10 games. Waaaaah !</li>
<li>4.12.2012 <strong>1865 - 1909. </strong>Hangled myself brutally back in the 1900s
    with 2 wins against a 2200 elo player. Played my 10 games...</li>
<li>8.12.2012 <strong>1797 - 1825 </strong>Don't ask. At least I played today 10
    games. 5 wins, 5 losts. I do now 5 * 10 pushups...</li>
<li>10.12.2012 <strong>1800 - 1847</strong></li>
<li>16.12.2012 <strong>1847 - 1823 </strong>Played 10 games...</li>
<li>18.12.2012 <strong>1800 - 2000 </strong>Hell yeah, I played at least 300 games
    the last days and I finally achieved the freakin 2000 Elo. To be
    honest, if I really tried I could crack my genuine goal of Elo 2050,
    but it's just ways to risky that I suddently digress and get
    unconcentrated and it begins all over. So I am stopping here. It's a
    new all time record since I played bullet chess (now aproximately 5
    years) and it's good like that. It's just too much time wasted ;)</li>
</ul>
<p>The message (not complete) I received on chess.com when I reached the
2000:</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><em>Congratulations <strong>zardaxt</strong> on achieving a high rating on Chess.com!
You are now among the strongest players on our site.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The challange ends with that...</p>
