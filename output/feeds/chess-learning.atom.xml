to stagnate or my performance even goes down the tubes. The reason
behind this, I am assuming, the absence of defined goal or when I play
without thinking (as far as thinking in bullet chess is the legit word)
or other bad behaviour, as listening to music...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I will try a little experiment: I play every day not more
than 10 bullet games. This is around 20 minutes of playing. But every
time I lose, I have to to 6 full and slow chin-ups. I'll play on
chess.com and my starting rating is right now &lt;strong&gt;1924&lt;/strong&gt;, which actually
is pretty high for me. Nevertheless, my goal is to reach ELO 2050. My
all time highscore is &lt;strong&gt;1974. &lt;/strong&gt;Let's go and breake some records...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok let the journey begin :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;26.11.2012: &lt;strong&gt;1924 - 1896. &lt;/strong&gt;Did around 30 chin-ups. Tired as hell.
    Lost too many times :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;28.11.2012 &lt;strong&gt;1896 - 1903. &lt;/strong&gt;Back in the 1900s. Did lot's of chin
    ups. My game improved slightly, I think more and deeper. My speed is
    still to slow...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;29.11.2012 &lt;strong&gt;1903 - 1900. &lt;/strong&gt;I am stagnating, I have the impression
    that I still lack creativity and don't really want to play. My
    motivation is weak, but I am ways more concentrated compared to
    playing endless long sessions. 4 from 10 games were chin-ups. That
    means 24 chin ups :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30.11.2012&lt;strong&gt;1900 - 1888&lt;/strong&gt;. What the fuck? I play excellent but
    freaking slow :/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.12.2012 &lt;strong&gt;1888 - 1926&lt;/strong&gt;. It goes up and up :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2.12.2012 &lt;strong&gt;1926 - 1945. &lt;/strong&gt;Seems like I am back in the solid 1900s.
    This rating is close to my all time high and I am looking forward to
    make a new record and to fullfill my goal!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3.12.2012 &lt;strong&gt;1945 - 1865&lt;/strong&gt;. Played like 50 games. That's the
    punishment. That was this opponent who really made me angry. Next
    time, I'll stick to the plan and won't get emotional. I shouldn't
    play more than 10 games. Waaaaah !&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4.12.2012 &lt;strong&gt;1865 - 1909. &lt;/strong&gt;Hangled myself brutally back in the 1900s
    with 2 wins against a 2200 elo player. Played my 10 games...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8.12.2012 &lt;strong&gt;1797 - 1825 &lt;/strong&gt;Don't ask. At least I played today 10
    games. 5 wins, 5 losts. I do now 5 * 10 pushups...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10.12.2012 &lt;strong&gt;1800 - 1847&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16.12.2012 &lt;strong&gt;1847 - 1823 &lt;/strong&gt;Played 10 games...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18.12.2012 &lt;strong&gt;1800 - 2000 &lt;/strong&gt;Hell yeah, I played at least 300 games
    the last days and I finally achieved the freakin 2000 Elo. To be
    honest, if I really tried I could crack my genuine goal of Elo 2050,
    but it's just ways to risky that I suddently digress and get
    unconcentrated and it begins all over. So I am stopping here. It's a
    new all time record since I played bullet chess (now aproximately 5
    years) and it's good like that. It's just too much time wasted ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message (not complete) I received on chess.com when I reached the
2000:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congratulations &lt;strong&gt;zardaxt&lt;/strong&gt; on achieving a high rating on Chess.com!
You are now among the strongest players on our site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challange ends with that...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
