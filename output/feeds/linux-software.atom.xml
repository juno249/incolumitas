&lt;p&gt;Hey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy new year to all of you and let 2015 be a succesful year for us
all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;New Year's resolution&lt;/strong&gt; is to write at least two blog posts every
month and try to get my scraping service on
&lt;a href="http://scrapeulous.com" title="my scraping service"&gt;scrapeulous.com&lt;/a&gt; up and
running!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Good program to record the desktop/audio on linux&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I really wanted to share today is an awesome way to record your
desktop with audio on Linux. I tried my luck several times with VLC, but
it's a freaking pain in the ass to use. Furthermore, VLC will probably
never be able to capture the desktop with audio (See &lt;a href="http://superuser.com/questions/612186/how-to-capture-screen-video-with-audio-using-vlc-media-player"&gt;this stackoverflow
thread&lt;/a&gt;
for more info).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I just found an wonderful alternative (one could almost assume that
I am advertisting, which is not the case, I swear!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/recordMyDesktop"&gt;http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/recordMyDesktop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to visit the home page of the program, &lt;a href="http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php"&gt;click
here&lt;/a&gt;. Although the
home page is very ugly and the program is not longer in active
development, it just works like a charm. On Ubuntu you may install it
like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install recordmydesktop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then go to a directory very you want to save the output file and just
enter &lt;code&gt;recordmydesktop&lt;/code&gt; in a shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program begins to record. When hitting Control-C, the capture stops
and the file is written (Which takes a bit time). Then you can play your
capture (With VLC for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows me once more what the most integral parts in the art of
software development really are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most common usage case of the program should be it's default
    behaviour!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usability is the most important part of any software. Users are
    frustrated very easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The program must be robust. If it doesn't work, potential customers
    are drained away to the concurrence!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these points apply on recordmydesktop, which makes it very nice to
work with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you got something out of this.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
