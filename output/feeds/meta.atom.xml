&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #00ff00;"&gt;Before you leave&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog and homepage is under construction. Due the fact that Im
currently implementing my own little wordpress theme and the rather
embarassing circumstance that my design knowledge is pretty ...eehhm...
basic, you'd better stay patient until you see the procution level of
this blog...That can last several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a 21 year old german programmer and hopefully somewhen in the
future a freelancing security consultant. In the foreseable future, I'll
post here audit sessions, papers and tutorials on this blog. I would
consider myself as a whitehat, so don't expect illicit stuff from me. My
favourite programming languages are Python and C. Everything I do for
myself and can be painless done in those programming languages, will be
done in one of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you ask yourself what &lt;strong&gt;incolumitas.com&lt;/strong&gt; means?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it's the latin translation for &lt;strong&gt;safety&lt;/strong&gt; and since every good
domain name is already taken, I just switched to a different language
(latin if you're curious) and a not so common word for safety. The DNS
name matches perfectly my needs, because it points directly to the main
intention of this site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Offering security services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can hire me. Don't hesitate to ask me anything...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
